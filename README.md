Cyber Threat Hunting
# What is threat hunting?
   Threat hunting, also called cyberthreat hunting, is a proactive method of uncovering previously unknown or ongoing threats within an organization’s network. It plays a critical role in strengthening defenses against ransomware, insider threats, and other cyberattacks that might otherwise remain undetected. Although automated security tools and security operations center (SOC) analysts successfully stop most attacks before they cause significant harm, advanced threats can sometimes evade these protections. Once an attacker gains access, they may remain hidden for weeks or even months. IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report reveals that it takes an average of 181 days to detect a breach—time in which adversaries can steal data, harvest credentials, and expand their access. The financial impact is severe: the average data breach costs organizations about USD 4.88 million, and the longer it takes to detect and contain an incident, the greater the losses. By actively hunting for hidden threats, security teams can detect breaches earlier, respond faster, and minimize the potential damage.
## How Cyberthreat Hunting Works
Cyberthreat hunters are highly skilled security professionals. They are often IT security analysts within an organization who understand its systems and operations, though external specialists may also take on the role. These teams leverage security automation tools to detect, track, and neutralize threats before they escalate into major incidents.Threat hunting relies heavily on data particularly the information collected from an organization’s threat detection platforms and other security technologies.Throughout the process, hunters meticulously analyze this data to uncover hidden malware, stealthy intruders, or any suspicious behavior that automated defenses may have overlooked. Once a threat is identified, they act quickly to eliminate it and reinforce security measures to prevent future incidents.
## Types of threat Hunting
Threat hunters typically start with a hypothesis an assumption formed from security data, observations, or another trigger. This hypothesis becomes the basis for a deeper investigation into possible threats.
Such investigations generally fall into three categories: structured, unstructured, and situational (or entity driven) hunting.

## Structured Hunting
This approach follows established frameworks, such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework, to look for specific indicators of attack (IoAs) and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by known adversaries.

## Unstructured Hunting
More reactive in nature, unstructured hunts usually begin when an indicator of compromise (IoC) is detected within a system. The goal is to uncover what caused the IoC and determine whether the threat is still active.

## Situational or Entity Driven Hunting
Situational hunts arise from an organization’s unique context often based on internal risk assessments, or analyses of vulnerabilities and emerging trends in the IT environment. Entity driven hunts, on the other hand, concentrate on high value assets or critical systems, with hunters seeking out threats that specifically endanger these resources and looking for any evidence of compromise.

## Threat hunting tools
To support their investigations, security teams rely on a range of specialized tools. Some of the most widely used include:

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
SIEM platforms help organizations detect and address threats before they can disrupt operations. They improve early attack detection while also reducing the number of false positives that hunters need to review.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR solutions leverage real time analytics and AI-driven automation to safeguard endpoints, users, and IT assets against advanced threats that bypass traditional endpoint defenses.

## Managed Detection and Response (MDR)
MDR is a managed security service that continuously monitors, detects, and responds to threats. By combining advanced technology with expert oversight, MDR strengthens proactive threat hunting, enables rapid incident response, and speeds up remediation efforts.

## Security Analytics
By applying big data techniques alongside machine learning and artificial intelligence, security analytics provide deeper visibility into security data. These insights accelerate threat hunting efforts by highlighting patterns and anomalies that may otherwise go unnoticed.

## Threat hunting / Threat intelligence
Threat intelligence, often referred to as cyberthreat intelligence, is actionable information that helps organizations anticipate, prevent, and respond to cyberattacks. It provides visibility into both the specific threats targeting an organization and the wider cybersecurity landscape. Threat hunters rely on this intelligence to carry out in-depth, organization wide investigations for potential intrusions. In essence, threat intelligence lays the groundwork, while threat hunting builds on it transforming insights into concrete actions that neutralize current threats and strengthen defenses against future ones.

## T-Pot - The All In One Multi Honeypot Platform
T-Pot functions as a honeytrap by running many simulated, intentionally vulnerable services to lure and engage attackers. Every interaction with these decoy systems is recorded, producing valuable threat intelligence without putting real production networks at risk.

## Core components of the T-Pot framework
* Multi-honeypot orchestration: T-Pot uses Docker to deploy and manage multiple honeypot instances that mimic common services—SSH, web servers, databases, and IoT endpoints—so it can capture a wide range of attacker behavior.

  * Cowrie: Emulates SSH and Telnet servers.
  * Dionaea: Detects malware and imitates protocols such as FTP and HTTP.
  * Wordpot: Simulates a vulnerable WordPress installation.

* Elastic Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are used to ingest, process, and visualize the interaction data gathered by the honeypots.
* Web dashboard: A browser-based interface provides a live attack map, Kibana visualizations, and other analysis tools for monitoring and investigation.
* Network monitoring integration: Tools like Suricata are incorporated to broaden network-level detection and enrich the collected threat data.

## Key benefits and typical uses

* Threat intelligence collection: T-Pot captures real-time data on attacker techniques, deployed malware, and malicious behavior.
* Early warning: Activity observed in the honeypots can act as an early indicator of threats before they touch production systems.
* Deception and distraction: The decoy services help divert attackers away from real assets, buying time for defenders to respond.
* Training and research: The environment provides a controlled, hands-on platform for analysts to study attacks and develop countermeasures.
* Simplified setup and management: Containerization via Docker makes deploying and operating a diverse honeypot ecosystem straightforward.
